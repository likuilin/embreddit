# embreddit.com

## update

Update: Reddit has fixed their gallery links, so this project is now unneccessary.

I have repurposed embreddit.com to now be an instance of [fxtumblr](https://github.com/knuxify/fxtumblr).

## original readme

Reddit gallery links don't generate embeds when posted on Discord.

Like [fxtwitter.com](https://github.com/FixTweet/FixTweet), embreddit.com fixes this.
